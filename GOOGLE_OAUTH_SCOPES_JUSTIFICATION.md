# Google OAuth Scopes Justification for LOUMASS

## Application Overview
LOUMASS is an email marketing and automation platform that enables users to send personalized email campaigns, manage contact lists, and track engagement metrics through their own Gmail account. Users maintain full control over their email sending, and all emails are sent directly from their Gmail account.

## Required Scopes and Detailed Justification

### 1. Gmail Send Scope
**Scope:** `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send`
**Why Required:** 
- Core functionality to send email campaigns on behalf of users
- Users create email campaigns in our interface and we send them through their Gmail account
- Each email is sent individually to maintain Gmail compliance and avoid spam filters
- Users explicitly trigger each campaign send
- Alternative scopes insufficient: Read-only scopes cannot send emails

### 2. Gmail Compose Scope  
**Scope:** `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose`
**Why Required:**
- Create draft emails for user review before sending
- Manage email sequences with scheduled drafts
- Allow users to preview and edit emails before sending
- Save campaign templates as drafts
- Alternative scopes insufficient: Send scope alone doesn't allow draft management

### 3. Gmail Modify Scope
**Scope:** `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify`
**Why Required:**
- Track email replies by marking processed emails
- Update email labels to organize campaign emails
- Mark emails as read after processing replies
- Manage email threads for conversation tracking
- Alternative scopes insufficient: Read-only cannot update email status

### 4. Gmail Read Scope
**Scope:** `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`
**Why Required:**
- Detect and track replies to campaign emails
- Monitor bounce backs and delivery failures
- Analyze email threads for engagement metrics
- Verify email delivery status
- Alternative scopes insufficient: Metadata alone doesn't provide email content needed for reply detection

### 5. User Info Email Scope
**Scope:** `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`
**Why Required:**
- Display user's Gmail address in the application
- Verify account ownership
- Set proper "from" address in emails
- Associate campaigns with correct account

## Why Less Permissive Scopes Are Insufficient

### Cannot Use Only gmail.send:
- Users need to create and review drafts before sending
- Cannot track replies or engagement without read access
- Cannot organize campaign emails with labels

### Cannot Use Only gmail.metadata:
- Metadata alone doesn't provide email body content needed to:
  - Detect actual replies vs auto-responses
  - Track specific campaign engagement
  - Identify bounce messages

### Cannot Use Gmail Addons Scopes:
- Our application is a web platform, not a Gmail addon
- Users access our service through our website, not within Gmail
- We need programmatic access to send bulk campaigns

## Data Usage and Security

### What We Do With Gmail Access:
1. **Send Emails:** Only when user explicitly triggers a campaign
2. **Track Replies:** Read only emails that are replies to campaigns
3. **Create Drafts:** For user review and scheduling
4. **Update Labels:** To organize campaign emails

### What We DON'T Do:
- Never read personal emails unrelated to campaigns
- Never send emails without user action
- Never share Gmail data with third parties
- Never store email passwords
- Never access emails outside of campaign context

## User Benefits Requiring These Scopes

1. **Full Campaign Control:** Users send professional email campaigns from their own Gmail
2. **Reply Tracking:** Automatically detect and track responses to campaigns
3. **Engagement Analytics:** Measure open rates, click rates, and replies
4. **Sequence Automation:** Create multi-step email sequences with conditions
5. **Contact Management:** Build relationships through personalized email communication

## Compliance and Best Practices

- All emails include unsubscribe links
- We enforce Gmail's sending limits
- Users must confirm consent before sending
- We track and respect unsubscribe requests
- Full compliance with CAN-SPAM and GDPR

## User Control

Users maintain complete control:
- Can revoke access anytime via Google Account settings
- See all emails being sent before campaigns launch
- Review all draft emails before sending
- Access full logs of all sent emails
- Export all their data at any time

## Why This Combination of Scopes

The requested scopes work together to provide a complete email marketing solution:
- **Send + Compose:** Create and send campaigns
- **Modify + Read:** Track engagement and responses
- **User Info:** Properly identify account and sender

Without ALL these scopes, the application cannot function as an email marketing platform. Each scope serves a specific, necessary purpose that cannot be achieved with less permissive alternatives.

This justification demonstrates that each requested scope is essential for LOUMASS to function as a complete email marketing platform, and that less permissive scopes would prevent core functionality that users expect and require.
