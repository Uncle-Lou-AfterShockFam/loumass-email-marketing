# OAuth Verification Pending - Workaround Solution

## Current Situation
Your app "LOUSMASS_NEW" is published but pending Google verification. During this period, you can still use the app with test users.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Add Test Users

While your app is pending verification, you can add up to 100 test users who can use the app immediately.

### Steps:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
   ```
   https://console.cloud.google.com/
   ```
   Select your project

2. **Navigate to OAuth Consent Screen**
   - APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen
   - You'll see "Publishing status: In production" with "Needs verification" warning

3. **Add Test Users (Works During Verification)**
   - Even though app is published, you can still add test users
   - Scroll to "Test users" section
   - Click "+ ADD USERS"
   - Add these emails:
     ```
     ljpiotti@aftershockfam.org
     [add any other emails that need access]
     ```
   - Click "SAVE"

4. **This Works Immediately**
   - Test users can access the app even during verification
   - No waiting required
   - Up to 100 test users allowed

## ALTERNATIVE: Use Development OAuth (Rollback Option)

If you had a working OAuth setup before, you can temporarily use those credentials:

1. **Check if you have another OAuth client** that was working:
   - In Google Cloud Console → Credentials
   - Look for other OAuth 2.0 Client IDs
   - One might be for development/testing that doesn't require verification

2. **Temporarily switch credentials in Vercel:**
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=[working client id]
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=[working client secret]
   ```

## Why This Happens

Google requires verification for apps that:
- Access sensitive Gmail scopes (send, modify, etc.)
- Are published for public use
- Have certain OAuth configurations

**Verification timeline:** Usually 3-5 business days

## What Test Users Can Do

Test users have FULL access to your app:
- ✅ Connect Gmail
- ✅ Send emails
- ✅ Use all features
- ✅ No restrictions

## Production Users (After Verification)

Once Google approves:
- Anyone can use the app
- No test user list needed
- Full production access

## Quick Fix Checklist

1. ✅ Add `ljpiotti@aftershockfam.org` to test users
2. ✅ Clear browser cookies for Google
3. ✅ Try connecting Gmail again
4. ✅ Should work immediately

## If Still Not Working

The test user approach ALWAYS works for apps pending verification. If it's not working:

1. **Double-check the email is added correctly**
2. **Clear ALL Google cookies**
3. **Try incognito window**
4. **Make sure you're using the right Google account**

**Note:** Since your app is already published and just pending verification, adding test users is the fastest solution. This bypasses the verification requirement while Google reviews your app.
